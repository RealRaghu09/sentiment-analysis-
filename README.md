Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
##ðŸ§  Overview

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews using the Kaggle Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews dataset.
The model classifies reviews into sentiment categories (e.g., negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive).

I trained the model on the Kaggle dataset, saved the trained weights, and built a simple frontend interface to predict the sentiment of user-entered movie reviews.
